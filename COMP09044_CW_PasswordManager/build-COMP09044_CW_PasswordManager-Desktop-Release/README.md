# ABOUT: COMP09044_CW_PasswordManagerProject
My coursework for COMP09044 'Algorithms &amp; Collections' @ University of the West of Scotland.

This coursework (code, documents & executable) was graded 51%.

# GETTING STARTED

Unzip the release folder in your preferred location.

The folder should contain three directories

+ COMP09044_CW_PasswordManager  (Linux build)
+ password-win-release		(Windows build)
+ tech-doc			(Technical documentation)

(If the Qt IDE is installed then you can simply open the project and build for your system)

## Windows

The Windows executable is already built, the folder contains all necessary dependancies thus the program can be contained within its folder - no installation necessary! This binary will also run on Linux if need be.

## Linux

Open 'COMP09044_CW_PasswordManager' in a terminal and simply run 'make'.

This will generate all dependencies alongside the Linux executable itself which can then be run from the terminal.
